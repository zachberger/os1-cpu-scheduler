(3 points) Based on your simulation results, which CPU scheduling algorithm results in the smallest response time for type A jobs? Explain why. 

The "Highest Priority First" ready queue provided the smallest response time for Type A jobs because A jobs have the highest priority, and the HPF ready queue sorts jobs based on priority. 
 
(3 points) Based on your simulation results, which CPU scheduling algorithm results in the smallest turnaround time for type B jobs? Explain why. 

The "Round Robin" ready queue provided the smallest turnaround time for Type B jobs.
 
(3 points) Based on your simulation results, which CPU scheduling algorithm results in the smallest response time for type C jobs? Explain why.

The "Highest Priority First" ready queue provided the smallest response time for Type C jobs because C jobs have a moderately high priority, and the HPF ready queue sorts jobs based on priority.
